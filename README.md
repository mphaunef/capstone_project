# **Mulberry**

 	
## Summary
Mulberry's main goal is to expose users to new songs based on their previous tastes and favorite genres. Built using Spotify's API in part, Mulberry randomly chooses a song from within one of your randomly choosen playlists. With this information and your hand-picked genre choice, Mulberry then asks Spotify's API for a song recommendation.

## About the Developer
 Mulberry was created by Megan Phaunef during her time at Hackbright Academy. Aspiring software engineer, Megan wanted to mesh her love for music and her newfound passion and curiosity in coding. During her path as a student in Cyber Security she decided she wanted something that allowed her more creativity so she turned to self-driven studies of programming until eventually landing a spot in a 100% tuition-covered sponsored cohort at Hackbright.

## Dynamically Generated Interactive Web Player
![Mulberry Homepage](d1.png)

Each genre presented in the genre dropdown are generated based on the available genre seeds Spotify has to offer, allowing users to pinpoint exactly which available genre they would like to receieve a song from. If genre seeds were to ever be deleted or created, this dropdown would update accordingly.

Song embeds are dynamically generated after a user-selected genre and a randomly selected song within a users library (and its information, e.g. song title, song artist, unique Spotify song ID) is given to the API to return a recommended new song. After querying a specific users' data and confirming if the returned song has been played or not, the embed will be displayed for the user to interact with using AJAX fetch requests. Users are able to play, pause, seek, favorite, share and open each song in Spotify's own application.


## User Profiles

User profiles are generated by querying for each genre a user has ever chosen and its corresponding songs. All information is loaded and hidden until interacted with using AJAX, creating a user-driven profile experience.


## User Favorites

Similar to user profiles, user favorites are generated and displayed after querying for a specific users favorited song information. This information is then loaded and display for a user to scroll.

Mulberry is an app built on a Flask server with a PostgreSQL database and SQLAlchemy as the ORM. The front end templating uses Jinja2, the HTML was built using a mix of Bootstrap and traditional CSS. Javascript uses JQuery and AJAX to interact with the backend for a more seamless user experience. JSON is used to convert Spotify return objects into compatible objects for both JavaScript and Python.
